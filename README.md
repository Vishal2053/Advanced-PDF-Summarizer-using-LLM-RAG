# Advance Pdf Summeraizer using llm RAG
 This project is an Advanced PDF Summarizer that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to generate concise and accurate summaries from PDF documents. The system is designed to handle large, complex documents and extract the most important information efficiently. It integrates LLMs for natural language understanding and generation, coupled with a retrieval mechanism to enhance summarization by grounding the model's output in the most relevant parts of the document.

## Project Overview

This project is an **Advanced PDF Summarizer** that utilizes **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide accurate and efficient summaries from PDF documents. With this system, users can upload PDF files, generate concise summaries, and interact with the document through a question-answering system.

The project is built on **Flask**, integrates **LLMs** like GPT-4 or similar, and uses **RAG** to retrieve the most relevant content from the documents, ensuring the summaries are factually accurate and contextually relevant.

## Features

- **PDF Upload**: Users can upload PDF files to the web application.
- **Summarization with LLMs**: Generate summaries from the uploaded PDF content using large language models.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: The system retrieves key sections of the document to enhance the summarization process.
- **Question Answering**: Users can query the document content and receive precise, context-aware responses.
- **Customizable Summary Length**: Summaries can be adjusted for length and depth based on user needs.
- **Flask API**: Easy-to-use REST API for integration with other platforms or services.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **PDF Parsing**: PyPDF2, PDFMiner
- **LLMs**: Hugging Face Transformers (e.g., GPT-4 or similar)
- **RAG**: LangChain, Chroma for document embeddings and retrieval
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS for a basic web interface (optional)
  
## How It Works

1. **PDF Parsing**: The user uploads a PDF file, and its text content is extracted using libraries like `PyPDF2` or `PDFMiner`.
2. **Document Embeddings**: Key sections of the document are converted into embeddings using `LangChain` and `Chroma`.
3. **Summarization with RAG**: The LLM processes these embeddings and generates a summary, augmenting it with relevant sections.
4. **Question Answering**: Users can query specific details from the PDF, and the system retrieves relevant information from the document using the same RAG process.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-pdf-summarizer-llm-rag.git
   cd advanced-pdf-summarizer-llm-rag
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Flask app**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open the application in your browser:
   ```bash
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

## Usage

### Uploading a PDF and Summarizing

1. Upload a PDF file via the web interface.
2. The system will process the document and generate a summary using the integrated LLM and RAG.
3. You can ask specific questions about the PDF by typing queries into the interface.

### Flask API

To integrate the summarizer with other applications, you can use the Flask API. Hereâ€™s an example of an API call:

- **Endpoint**: `/summarize`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Payload**: PDF file in the request body
- **Response**: JSON object containing the generated summary.

## Future Enhancements

- **Support for Multiple Languages**: Expand the system to summarize PDFs in various languages.
- **Improved Web Interface**: Design a more user-friendly interface with custom settings for summarization.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the app on cloud platforms (AWS, Heroku, etc.) for broader accessibility.
- **Optimized Memory Usage**: Refine the document processing pipeline to handle extremely large PDFs more efficiently.
